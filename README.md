Residential Real Estate Development & Clean Energy Forecasting: 

A Python-based financial model for forecasting residential real estate development, integrating clean energy savings using live solar irradiance data.

Project Overview:

This project builds a financial feasibility model for residential real estate products (e.g single-family detached housing units, single-family attached housing units and multi-family housing units). It combines:

•	Absorption modeling (forecasting unit sales over time)

•	Revenue and expense forecasts 

•	IRR and cashflow analysis

•	Integration of clean energy savings based on real solar radiation data pulled from the Open-Meteo API.

Use Case:

A real estate developer, analyst, or sustainability consultant can use this model to estimate:

•	Feasibility of a new residential project


•	The impact of solar installations on long-term financials

•	How to product mix influences cash flow and profitability

Features:

•	Live solar irradiance data via Open-Metro API

•	Forecast unit absorption schedules

•	Calculate revenue, Operating expenses, solar savings, and NOI

•	Compute Net Cash Flow and IRR

•	Export results as csv

•	Modular Python design for easy extension

•	User inputs for full customization

Technoligies Used

•	Python 3.13

•	pandas

•	numpy

•	numpy_financial

•	requests

•	Open-Meteo API

How it works:

•	User provides:

•	City name (for solar data)

•	Solar system size (kW)

•	Local electricity rates

•	Real estate product type and financial assumptions

The model fetches live solar radiation data for the city.

It calculates:

•	Annual solar savings

•	Absorption schedules

•	Revenue, expenses, solar savings

•	IRR and net cash flow

•	Outputs a summary CSV and prints results in the terminal
